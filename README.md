# Truck Maintenance Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing maintenance planning for a truck fleet by predicting air system defects. Leveraging historical maintenance data, the goal is to reduce maintenance costs associated with false negatives and prevent unnecessary inspections. This initial version includes preliminary analyses and model evaluations.

## Current Status
The first version includes data cleaning processes essential for preparing the dataset. Due to time constraints during the week, this version represents the progress made so far. Further improvements and additional analyses will be implemented in the next update.
